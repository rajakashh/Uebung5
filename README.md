This repository contains three Java programming assignments, each implemented in a separate package (h1, h2, h3) with its own main method. All solutions follow the exact task requirements and are designed to work independently.

The first assignment reverses the order of elements in an integer array. The second assignment determines the number of digits of a non-negative integer and stores each digit individually in a fixed-size array, aligned to the right. The third assignment decomposes a given amount of money (in cents) into the minimum number of banknotes and coins using a predefined denomination array.

Each program is structured clearly, respects the given constraints, and fulfills the specified assumptions for testing.
